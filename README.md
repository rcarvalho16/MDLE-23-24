## Large-Scale Data Mining Repository, Group 3, Summer Semester 23/24

**Project Overview:**

This repository contains the work completed for the Big Data Mining course as part of the Master's in Computer Engineering at ISEL. The course delved into the fundamentals of Big Data, Apache Spark, and Machine Learning. We focused on essential data science concepts such as data analysis, preprocessing, sampling techniques, and dimensionality reduction.

**Repository Structure:**

The repository is organized into folders named "Aula Pr√°tica X" (Practical Class X), each containing the implementation and report (written in Portuguese) for a specific practical assignment.

**Final Project (Trabalho Pratico):**

The final project aimed to implement machine learning models to answer two research questions using the Energy and Weather datasets:

1. **Can we infer whether a municipality is predominantly industrial or residential based on the evolution of energy consumption throughout the day?**
2. **Can we predict energy consumption based on forecasted weather conditions?**

**Methodology:**

* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** In-depth analysis of variables, characteristics, data quality, and validity.
* **Data Cleaning:** Imputation of missing values using techniques like standard deviation, mean, or zero, as appropriate.
* **Dimensionality Reduction:** Feature selection (Fisher's Ratio, Information Gain) and feature reduction (PCA).
* **Data Balancing:** Oversampling, SMOTE, and undersampling techniques were applied to balance the dataset.
* **Model Training:** Using Apache Spark, we trained various models, including:
    * **For question 1:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Trees.
    * **For question 2:** Linear Regression, Gradient Boosted Trees.
* **Performance Evaluation:** Assessment of model performance using relevant metrics.

**Key Takeaways:**

* **Practical Application:** The project provided hands-on experience with big data technologies and machine learning algorithms.
* **Problem-Solving:** We addressed real-world challenges in energy consumption prediction and classification.
* **Technical Skills:** Demonstrated proficiency in Apache Spark, data preprocessing, and model evaluation.
